Rune takes your privacy very seriously. We believe your reading habits are personal and should remain private.

## Data Collection

**Rune collects no personal data.**

We do not have servers that store your articles, feeds, or reading history. All data is stored locally on your device and synced via your personal iCloud account if enabled. We do not have access to any of your content.

## Analytics

To help us improve the app, we use [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com/) to collect anonymous usage data. This data helps us understand how the app is used (e.g., which features are popular, crash reports) without identifying you personally.

TelemetryDeck does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). It does not track your IP address, device ID, or any other data that could be traced back to you.

You can view TelemetryDeck's privacy policy [here](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/).

## Third-Party Services

In the future, if we introduce any features that rely on third-party services (e.g., for article parsing or AI summarization), we will update this policy to reflect those changes. Currently, even AI features are powered by on-device intelligence where possible.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [hello@lachlaneagling.com](mailto:hello@lachlaneagling.com).
